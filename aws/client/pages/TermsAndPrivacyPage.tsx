          Economic Area ("EEA"), and/or other regions with comprehensive data
          protection laws, to other countries worldwide for storage, processing,

          collect the following categories of personal data: Log data: Our
          servers automatically record information created by your access,
          viewing, and use of the Website, sent by your computer, mobile phone,
          or other access devices. This data is collected by server logs and
          cookies (see explanation below) and may include information such as
          your IP address, login information, device ID or unique identifier,
          device type, geo-location information, operating system and browser
          type, the date and time of visits to the Website, the pages viewed or
          searched for, time spent on our Website, and the internet sites
          visited just before and just after our Website. Our services: We
          collect personal data and information regarding an individual for the
          purposes of assessing potential business relationships with that
          person, and subsequently during that business relationship. Such
          personal data may include your full name; contact information;
          financial information, e.g., related to payment for services; your
          image; personal data provided to us by you or generated by us in the
          course of providing our services to you; and any other information you
          choose to share with us. You may also give your consent for the
          processing of your personal data for one or more specific purposes.
          Contacting us: If you contact us through the Website, email, or
          otherwise, we may keep your message, email address, and contact
          information to respond to your request. Providing such information is
          entirely optional. Cookies and site tracking We use cookies and
          similar technologies (e.g., web beacons, pixels, ad tags, and device
          identifiers) to recognize you and/or your device(s) on, off, and
          across different services and devices. A cookie is a small text file,
          which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a
          website, that site's computer asks your computer for permission to
          store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated
          for cookies. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if
          your browser's preferences allow it, but, to protect your privacy,
          your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has
          already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Most
          web browsers automatically accept cookies, but, if you wish, you can
          change these browser settings by accepting, rejecting, and deleting
          cookies. The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell
          you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to
          have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to
          disable cookies altogether. If you choose to change these settings,
          you may find that certain functions and features will not work as
          intended. As you use our Website, the Website uses its cookies to
          differentiate you from other users. Cookies, in conjunction with our
          internet server's log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate
          number of people visiting our Website and which parts of the Website
          are most popular. In addition, this Website uses the following
          services: Google Analytics. Google Analytics is a web analysis service
          provided by Google Inc., which works using cookies. This helps us
          gather feedback to constantly improve our Website and better serve our
          customers. Information about cookies used by or in connection with
          Google Analytics can be found at:
          https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage.
          By using our Website, you consent to the processing of data about you
          by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above. Social
          Media Plugins. Our Website may use social media plugins, such as the
          "like" button from Facebook or Twitter. These plugins may collect
          information such as your IP address, which page you are visiting on
          our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function
          properly. Social media plugins are either hosted by a third party or
          hosted directly on our Website. Your interactions with these plugins
          are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it. Legal
          basis for processing your personal data The legal basis for processing
          your personal data includes your consent; performance of a contract
          where you are a party; compliance with legal obligations we are
          subject to; and legitimate interests pursued by us or a third party,
          except where such interests are overridden by your interests or
          fundamental rights and freedoms which require protection of personal
          data. We may process your personal data on more than one legal basis,
          depending on the specific purpose for which we are using your personal
          data. Sharing your personal data with third parties We do not sell,
          rent, or trade your personal data to third parties. We may share your
          personal data with: Affiliated companies within our corporate family
          for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Third-party service
          providers or consultants working on our behalf, such as website
          hosting, data analysis, payment processing, order fulfillment,
          information technology and related infrastructure provision, customer
          service, email delivery, auditing, and other services. Third parties,
          if we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the
          rights, property, or safety of our company, our customers, or others,
          or to comply with legal or regulatory requirements. A buyer or other
          successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring,
          reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all
          of our company's assets, whether as a going concern or as part of
          bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which personal data
          held by us about our Website users is among the assets transferred. We
          may share aggregated or de-identified information, which cannot
          reasonably be used to identify you. International transfer of personal
          data Your personal data may be transferred to, and processed in,
          countries other than the country in which you are resident. These
          countries may have data protection laws that are different from the
          laws of your country. We have implemented appropriate safeguards to
          require that your personal data will remain protected in accordance
          with this Privacy Policy. Data security We have implemented measures
          designed to secure your personal data from accidental loss and from
          unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. All personal
          data you provide to us is stored on secure servers behind firewalls.
          Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology. The
          safety and security of your information also depend on you. Where we
          have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to
          certain parts of our Website, you are responsible for keeping this
          password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with
          anyone. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the
          internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect
          your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal
          data transmitted to our Website. Any transmission of personal data is
          at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any
          privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website. Data
          retention We retain personal data we collect from you where we have an
          ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you
          with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal,
          tax, or accounting requirements). When we have no ongoing legitimate
          business need to process your personal data, we will either delete or
          anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
          personal data has been stored in backup archives), then we will
          securely store your personal data and isolate it from any further
          processing until deletion is possible. Your data protection rights
          Depending on the country in which you reside, you may have the
          following data protection rights: To access, correct, update, or
          request deletion of your personal data. We take reasonable steps to
          ensure that the data we collect is reliable for its intended use,
          accurate, complete, and up to date. You may contact us directly at any
          time about accessing, correcting, updating, or deleting your personal
          data, or altering your data, by emailing us at dan@boltfoundry.com. We
          will consider your request in accordance with applicable laws. In
          addition, if you are a resident of the European Union, you can object
          to processing of your personal data, ask us to restrict processing of
          your personal data, or request portability of your personal data.
          Again, you can exercise these rights by emailing us at
          dan@boltfoundry.com. Similarly, if we have collected and processed
          your personal data with your consent, then you can withdraw your
          consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the
          lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal,
          nor will it affect processing of your personal data conducted in
          reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent. You have the
          right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection
          and use of your personal data. For more information, please contact
          your local data protection authority. We respond to all requests we
          receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection
          rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws. Age
          Limitation We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal data from
          anyone under the age of 16. If you are under 16, please do not attempt
          to register for the Website or send any personal data about yourself
          to us. If we learn that we have collected personal data from a child
          under age 16, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.
          If you believe that a child under 16 may have provided us personal
          data, please contact us at dan@boltfoundry.com. Links to Other Sites
          Our Website may contain links to other sites that are not operated by
          us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that
          third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy
          Policy of every site you visit. We have no control over, and assume no
          responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any
          third party sites or services. Changes to This Privacy Policy We may
          update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any
          changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. We will let
          you know via email and/or a prominent notice on our Website, prior to
          the change becoming effective and update the "effective date" at the
          top of this Privacy Policy. You are advised to review this Privacy
          Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy
          are effective when they are posted on this page. Contact Us If you
          have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us by
