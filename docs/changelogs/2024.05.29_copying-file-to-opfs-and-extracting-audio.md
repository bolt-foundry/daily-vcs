# PoC: Local encoding

1. Adds a few tools from the legacy "the-code" github repo. Most notably, a perf
   logger and encoding tools which we use to extract and encode audio and video.
   Not very happy with these tools, as they're not pipelined at all, and just a
   waterfall.

2. Moved the worker from a sharedworker to a dedicated worker (in
   [ProjectNew.tsx](/packages/client/pages/ProjectNew.tsx)) This is mostly for
   debugging reasons... the console.log output is visible in the main thread.

3. Updated
   [BfWorkerFileIngestion.ts](/packages/mediaProcessing/BfWorkerFileIngestion.ts)
   to work with the new encoder setup

That's basically it. Test plan is upload a video and see if it works lol.
