# Relay file uploading proof of concept

Only a few key changes in this:

1. We updated the relay environment to accept uploadables... and when we do an
   uploadable, use formdata to pull it all together.
2. ProjectNew has a button to upload a pretend text file
3. There's a new scalar type called File
4. New "read file" mutation which is essentially pointless.

Important: We intentionally made it so the variable File is required, but the
variable isn't actually checked. It'll be overwritten by whatever is in
"uploadables" which is sent as a file upload.
