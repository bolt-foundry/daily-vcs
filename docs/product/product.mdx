Bolt Foundry: Helping Businesses Amplify Their Voice Through Video

Mission:
Bolt Foundry's primary mission is to help people disseminate their information widely without needing to be video experts. By transforming recorded content into engaging and informative videos, we enable others to learn and benefit from the material.

Problems We Solve:
Initially, we assisted standup comedians and comedy clubs by turning long comedy sets into short clips. Now, we're transitioning to help businesses leverage customer testimonial recordings, transforming them into valuable content and ads for various social platforms.

Target Users:
Our focus has shifted from creators and comedians to marketers and B2B businesses. We typically work with companies that have marketing departments of five or more people and annual revenues exceeding $10 million.

Main Features:
Our AI tools allow businesses to use a search box or prompt box to request clips on specific topics or themes, returning relevant content quickly and efficiently.

Differentiation:
Rather than competing directly with other video creation tools, we prioritize serving new customer segments and meeting their unique needs.

Success Stories:
Comedy customers use our tools to post daily on social media. A recent client, Pattern, is leveraging our services to publish customer testimonials from trade shows, both internally and externally.

Vision for the Future:
We envision keeping Bolt Foundry a small company with five cofounders, collaborating with agencies and freelancers to build out most of the business.

Founding Story:
Our journey began when we left our well-paying jobs at Facebook to pursue this startup, working at roughly minimum wage to bring our vision to life.
